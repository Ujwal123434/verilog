# Combinational-Circuits
This folder contains basic combinational circuits written in verilog.

Combinational circuits give output based  on current inputs.
There is no clock and memory used

-Full Adder
-Half Subtractor
-Full Subtractor 
-Multiplexer
-Demultiplexer
-Encoder
-Decoder
-Comparator 
Each circuit has:
-A Verilog design  file(.v)
-A testbench file for simulation 
-A schematic
